Welcome back. In this step, let's understand what is Cloud and why do we need the Cloud:
Let's consider a couple of use cases. Let's start with a online shopping application.
What is the challenge that an online shopping application faces?

Online shopping applications typically have peak usage during holidays and weekends.
For example, during the Christmas period and the New Year period, you'd have a lot of load on the application and rest of the time you'll have low loads on the application.
Now, what was the solution before the cloud?
The solution before the Cloud was to do peak load provisioning.
What is peak load provisioning?
It is to buy infrastructure or procure infrastructure for the peak load.
So, if this is the peak load you expect, you'd buy infrastructure to support that kind of a load.
Now, think about this.
What would that infrastructure be doing in periods of low load?
It would just be sitting idle. Now,
let's consider another example.
Take a startup.
What is a challenge that it faces?
This challenge is also kind of a good news.
The startup suddenly becomes popular.
But what do you need is more infrastructure to support the load.

How do you handle the sudden increase in the load?
What was the solution before the Cloud?
Again, it was to procure infrastructure, assuming that you would be successful.
And what if you are not really successful?
All the infrastructure that you bought is wasted.
So, the typical challenges before the emergence of Cloud were the high cost of procuring infrastructure.

If you want to buy infrastructure ahead of time, it is very expensive and it also needs ahead of time
planning.
Can you really guess the future?
Can you accurately estimate the peak load?
The other challenge is low infrastructure utilization.
You can do peak load provisioning and buy infrastructure for the peak load, but during the rest of
the time, the infrastructure is wasted.
You have low infrastructure utilization and you need a dedicated infrastructure maintenance team to
maintain this infrastructure.

Think about a startup.
Can they afford a dedicated infrastructure maintenance team?
And because of these challenges, we started moving towards the Cloud.

Whenever we use the cloud, we are talking about a simple question.
How about provisioning or renting resources when we want them and releasing them back to the Cloud when
you do not need them?

This is also called On-demand resource provisioning.

If you have high load on your application, if you have huge number of users using the application,
you'll provision or you'll rent a lot of resources from the Cloud.

And once the load goes down, once the number of users on your application goes down, you'll release
the resources back to the Cloud.

You can see that the number of resources you use, increases with the number of users who are using the
application and that's why this is also called elasticity.

Now, what are the advantages of this approach?
You're trading capital expense for variable expense.
Instead of investing money ahead of time, you're paying rent.
You can benefit from the massive economies of scale.
Each of the popular Cloud providers have millions of servers and therefore they can get the best deals from the hardware providers.
And because the cloud space is very competitive, the cloud providers pass on that advantage to their
customers, that's us.
The other advantage is that you don't really need to guess capacity anymore.
If the number of users increase, you can provision more servers.
If the number of users goes down, you can release them back to the Cloud.
So, you don't really need to guess capacity anymore and you don't really need to spend any money running
and maintaining your data centres.
The other big advantage is that you can go global in minutes.

And over the last few years, Azure has proved to be reliable, secure, and cost-effective.
